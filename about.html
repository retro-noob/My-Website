            <p>
                My journey as a designer started already at the age 16 when attending the High School . After that I got my bachelor   degree in
                Computer Science and Engineering. This has helped me to widen 
                my range of knowledge and gather experiences through various disciplines, such as front-end development, computer visions, 
                 photography, videography, , and many more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well-organised person, problem solver. With high attention to detail. Fan of photography, travelling and web series.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work is something I do with lot of honesty, appetite and commitment,
                 I don't like to define myself by the work i've done. I define myself by the work i want to do. Skills can be taught,
                personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning,continue challenging myself and do interesting things that matter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I'm easily inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever
                 they take me. I'm passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I'm never 
                 satisfied to just come up with ideas instead i have an almost impulsive need to act on them.

            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a people-person with deep emotions and empathy, a natural storyteller. I'm able to inspire and am at my best when I'm 
                sharing my creative expressions with others.
